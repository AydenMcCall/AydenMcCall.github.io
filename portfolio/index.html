                <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
                <p>
                I've had an interest in programming ever since I was a kid, probably because I grew up playing games.
                I enjoyed them so much that it became a passion of mine to create them myself! After delving into the world of programming for this dream,
                I found joy in programming all sorts of projects. Nowadays I'm working towards my degree in Software Development, 
                and pushing myself to learn as much as I can from each project
                !</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Some of my interests</h3>
                <p>
                Aside from programming, I've always had a fondness for reading. 
                I'd often stay up far too late reading whatever book had interested 
                me most at the time. As a product of this, I've grown quite fond of writing as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I've never been too much into traditional sports, I've grown a softspot for martial arts and similar contact sports. I hope that 
                    I'll be able to resume these sports once the things have calmed down a bit more, as I enjoyed them greatly.
                </p>
